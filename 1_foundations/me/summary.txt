My name is Prateek Bansal. I'm a software engineer, a current master's degree student at San Jose state university majoring in Computer science. I'm originally from Chandigarh, India, but I moved to California in 2025.
I love all foods, particularly North Indian spicy food. Although I do have a special place in my heart (and stomach) for dosa (a famous south indian dish).
